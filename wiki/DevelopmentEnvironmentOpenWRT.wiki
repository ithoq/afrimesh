= Overview =

  To build Afrimesh nodes you will be maintaining two buckets of source: openwrt and afrimesh.  You will then wire up the afrimesh source into the openwrt toolchain.  Organizationally, you'll probably want to maintain a source directory with one folder for openwrt and one for afrimesh.  *All commands below are run from the perspective of the top level source directory unless otherwise noted*

= 1. Checkout OpenWRT =

  * Run:
  {{{
  svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/8.09 kamikaze
  }}}
  This will create the kamikaze directory

= 2. Checkout Afrimesh = 

  * Run:
  {{{ 
  svn checkout http://afrimesh.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ afrimesh
  }}}
  this will create the afrimesh directory

= 3. Setup OpenWRT =

  * Add this line to the top of feeds.conf.default in the kamikaze directory:
  {{{
  src-cpy afrimesh ../afrimesh/package-scripts/openwrt
  }}}

  * Run from kamikaze directory:
  {{{
  ./scripts/feeds update -a
  }}}


= 4. Activate Packages =

 * Run from kamikaze directory:
  {{{
  ./scripts/feeds install batmand 
  ./scripts/feeds install libjson 
  ./scripts/feeds install afrimesh-dashboard
  }}}

  * Run:
  {{{
  make menuconfig
  # Under Administration select with a *:
  # afrimesh-base for basic node (participates in the mesh and lets hosts connect)
  # TODO for gateway node (adds visualization server, Administration server?)
  }}}
