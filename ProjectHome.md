The ability to easily create an IP network in rural areas, developing countries and disaster zones makes it much easier for people to communicate with one another.

Building on the innovative research efforts and tireless support of the [Wireless Africa](http://wirelessafrica.meraka.org.za) group at the Meraka Institute of the CSIR, the sometimes terrifying growth of the [Scarborough Wireless Users Group](http://swug.za.net) and tools developed by the [Open Mesh](http://www.open-mesh.net) team Afrimesh provides a simple management dashboard helping network operators create and sustain resilient communications networks with a minimum of fuss.
