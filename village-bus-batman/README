B.A.T.M.A.N.-III visualization server

BETTER APPROACH TO MOBILE AD-HOC NETWORKING

# PURPOSE          #

The fact that no participant in a B.A.T.M.A.N. mesh network knows the entire topology is one of the most interesting features of the B.A.T.M.A.N. protocol.
Unfortunately, this is quite unhandy if you plan to visualize your network and its connections. In order to overcome that limitation every B.A.T.M.A.N. client has the
ability to send various information about its neighbours and their link quality to a visualization server. The server collects the data and offers an assembled output in
the well known "dot draw" format which you can use to visualize your topology with e.g. olsrs3d / meshs3d (part of the s3d project - s3d.berlios.de).

# USAGE            #
####################


To start the visualization server issue the following command:

vis <iface1> <iface2>

where iface1 is the interface for incoming B.A.T.M.A.N. packets and iface2 is used for the dot draw output. the server can run on different interfaces but this is not neccessary.


Every B.A.T.M.A.N. client which should be visible on your visualization must add the "-s" parameter:

batmand -s <ip_of_vis_server> <other_batmand_options>

and (obviously) must be able to reach the vis server.


You can check your setup by simply connecting with telnet to your vis server installation on port 2004:

telnet <ip_of_vis_server> 2004


Don't forget to adjust your firewal settings in case you use any: On the vis server you need to allow incoming traffic on TCP port 2004 and UDP port 4307.
